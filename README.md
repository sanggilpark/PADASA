## General Introduction
In the multiple bank system, systemic risk is the main concern for financial stability. Systemic risk could levarage failure of a single bank to a breakdown of banking system that affects the whole economy. Thus, it is crucial to examine the systemic risk nature. We will investigate the resilience of the banking systems upon the effect of systemic risk by observing the effect of financial shock directed to one bank on number of failing bank under varying values of key model parameters.

 
## The Model
To construct simplified model of the banking system we will employ the network theory where each node corresponds to a bank and each linkage between the nodes represents a directional lending relationship.
Our model initiates a financial shock at one bank and transmits overflow that cannot be paid via links to the lending banks, potentially causing them to fail and spreading the shock recursively through the network. This model is called "knock-on defaults".
Parameters of the model are: capitalization level, degree of connectivity, size of interbank susceptibility, and degree of the concentration.
We will vary these four parameters and relate them with the number of defects, describing resilience of banking systems.

## Fundamental Questions
* How much effect of chainging one parameter depend on values of other ones(fixed)?
* How expected count of defaults can be expressed can be expressed or at least described as a function of model parameters?
* How repeatable are the results for fixed parameters? (variation between realizations?)
* Which model parameters can be influenced by regulators and what should they aim for?
